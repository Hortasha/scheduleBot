// Must Implement:
// %score Refresh   -- after the monthly reward has been awarded. Admin can refresh the scoreboard

// LATER
// %role create     -- After achived certain amount of score. You can create your own role. (Not monthly score)
// %role color      -- Change the color of your role
// %role assign     -- Assign the role to someone
// %role remove     -- Remove your role, and maybe create a new one?
// %score give      -- give some of your score to someone (does not effect monthly score)
// %event info      -- info about specific event
// %event mine      -- show all of your own events


//Fix:
